# Teaching Programming Fundamentals with Candy Catch
## About

Candy Catch is a 2-player competitive item catching game that uses Scratch. Players will learn about 'if-then' and 'while' statements.

## Description 
* Difficulty: Easy
* Target Audience: Elementary - High School
* Duration of Workshop: 60 minutes
* Needed Material: Scratch.com, A computer with internet access
* The primary goal of this project is teaching participants the basic logical operators and statements, such as ‘if’ statements and ‘while’ loops through block-coding in scratch.
* Scratch is a basic programming where code blocks are created visually by draagging sections of code onto a workspace. 
* The Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

# Abstract 
~~Programming has grown to become a lucrative industry that has increased exponentially in demand throughout the years and will continue into the future. We are members of the TAP program at GGC where we explore different technologies in order to expose new technology with people. The purpose of our project is to introduce basic programming skills and the world of IT through a fun and engaging game. Concepts we teach include if-then statements, loops, variables, and conditions all within Scratch. Scratch is a block-coding based software that introduces these concepts to beginners through interactive games. Student can decide, after creating their custom copy of our game, if they would like to pursue a future in Programming. Participants will be able to experiment with these basic concepts, which we believe is an integral part of programming. Those who participate will learn new skills in a short amount of time.~~ 

Programming has grown to become a lucrative industry that has increased exponentially in demand throughout the years and will continue into the future. We are members of the Technology Ambassador Program (TAP) at GGC. We explore different technologies in order to expose new technology to people. The purpose of our project is to introduce basic programming skills, and the world of IT through a fun and engaging game. Our project will teach basic programming concepts that include if-then statements, loops, variables, and conditions. Participants will be able to experiment with these basic concepts, which we believe are an integral part of programming. Our project will use Scratch to teach these concepts to students. Scratch is a block-coding based software that will introduce these concepts to beginners through interactive games. We hope that our project will encourage students to pursue a career in programming after they create a custom version of our candy catching game. 



## Outreach Activities
- Tap Expo, April 1, 2021, GGC - To promote IT field and the TAP program to college student.
-  Class Workshops, April 12th - 14th, 2021, 2021 - To promote IT field to non-IT college students.
