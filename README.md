## :computer: Technology
We are using Scratch, a block coding based software to introduce basic coding concepts to beginners through interactive games. Block Coding utilizes a drag-and-drop learning environment where programmers use blocks to construct basic programs.
Sphero is a robotic ball that can be programmed in the Sphero EDU app. The Sphero EDU app uses block coding similar to Scratch.
