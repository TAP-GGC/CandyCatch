# Teaching Programming Fundamentals with Candy Catch
## About

Candy Catch is a 2-player competitive item catching game that uses Scratch. Players will learn about 'if-then' and 'while' statements.
The workshop strives to captivate students' interests toward the IT field by teaching them these basic programming concepts through a fun and interractive game developement process.

## Description 
* Difficulty: Easy
* Target Audience: Elementary - High School
* Duration of Workshop: 60 minutes
* Needed Material: Scratch.com, A computer with internet access
* The primary goal of this project is teaching participants the basic logical operators and statements, such as ‘if’ statements and ‘while’ loops through block-coding in scratch.
* Scratch is a basic programming where code blocks are created visually by draagging sections of code onto a workspace. 
* The Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## Technology
We are using Scratch, a block coding based software to introduce basic coding concepts to beginners through interactive games. Block Coding utilizes a drag-and-drop learning environment where programmers use blocks to construct basic programs.
Sphero is a robotic ball that can be programmed in the Sphero EDU app. The Sphero EDU app uses block coding similar to Scratch.
